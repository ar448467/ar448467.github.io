2. Nf3 d6</p><p>At lower levels of chess and even club levels the Philidor Defense is common so even if you don’t intend to play it yourself it’s always important to understand how to play against it.</p><p>The main line is for white to play 3. d4 but 3. Bc4 is also an option and one that I personally enjoy as it also gives white the option to try out the Legal Trap.</p><p>If you do play 3. d4 be careful if your opponent plays the aggressive 3…f5 line as white can find himself in some bad positions if played incorrectly.</p><p>Check out the video below to learn more about all the different variations in the Philidor Defense.</p><p><div class="grid-50 hide-on-mobile padding-bottom ad50-wrap"><script async="" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
