It is called this because of how easy it is to transpose into a variety of different opening lines. Many players have a very defined defense as black but against the Reti, black is forced to almost wait and see which opening line white will take. Some of the main opening lines that the Reti will transpose into are the Queen’s Gambit, the English, the Ruy Lopez, or the King’s Indian Attack. As you can tell, white has many different options to choose from, even after he has already moved.</p><p>Most players are more comfortable moving a pawn on their first move as white to control the center but the Reti opening uses a flank technique to attack the center with its minor piece and allows for quick castling on the kingside.</p><p>White also puts pressure on the e5 square which black would like to occupy but white also does not commit to a specific center pawn structure.</p><p>For those players that have a good understanding of multiple openings and are used to developing the king’s knight to the f3 square early on will really enjoy playing the Reti Opening as it gives you more options than other defined openings.</p><p>Watch the video below to watch more detailed explanations of the opening, multiple variations, and extended lines.</p><p><div class="grid-50 hide-on-mobile padding-bottom ad50-wrap"><script async="" src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
